     <h1>Ingredients</h1>
     <ul>
       <li>1 (16 ounce) can refrigerated jumbo buttermilk biscuits</li>

       <li>1 (9.6 ounce) package Jimmy Dean Original Hearty Pork Sausage Crumbles</li>

       <li>1/4 cup flour</li>

       <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>

       <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
     </ul>
     <h1>Directions</h1>
     <ol>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange biscuits 1 to 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 13 to 15 minutes.</li>

       <li>Meanwhile, cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until thoroughly heated, stirring frequently, about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>

       <li>Stir in flour until well combined. Gradually add milk, stirring continuously, until the gravy thickens and comes to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer and stir for 2 more minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>

       <li>Split biscuits in half. Place 2 halves on each of 8 plates; top with about 1/3 cup gravy.</li>
