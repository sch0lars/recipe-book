    <h1 class="title">Spam Musubi</h1>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>12 ounces Spam</li>
      <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
      <li>Nori roasted seaweed used for sushi, cut into halves or thirds</li>
      <li>6 cups cooked sushi rice WITHOUT the vinegar mixture added</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Slice the SPAM into about 8-10 slices (depending on how thick you like it) and put in a Zip-Lock bag. Mix oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sugar until sugar is dissolved and add to the bag with the SPAM. Marinate for about 15 minutes.</li>

      <li>Drain off marinade and fry SPAM on each side over medium heat until slightly crispy or until desired doneness. You can also wait to add marinade to SPAM after it has been cooked.</li>

      <li>Place a strip of nori on a cutting board or clean surface (shiny side down). Add Sushi Rice to the nori, pressing down firmly and evenly so there is about 1-1 1/2 inches of rice.</li>

      <li>Add some of the cooked SPAM to the top. Wrap up one side of the nori and stick it to the top of the SPAM, then wrap up the other side. Use a little water on your finger to seal if needed. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
